The project for our EEE3088F Electrcial Design course requires that we each design subsystems that will be integrated to build a Micro-mouse. This project covers the design and production of the sensing and power subsystems. Other systems such as processing subsystem, and motherboard are provided to us.

In this repository, one will find the detailed reports on how each subsystem was designed and tested and the gerber files for each subsystem.

Project files for the sensing subsystem can be found in: [Sensing](https://github.com/griffblob/EEE3088-69/tree/main/EEE3088%20Sensing)

Project files for the power subsystem can be found in: [Power](https://github.com/griffblob/EEE3088-69/tree/main/EEE3088%20Power)

Our reports can be found in [Reports](https://github.com/griffblob/EEE3088-69/tree/main/Reports). However, they will only be available after final submission closes to minimize the risk of plagarism.
