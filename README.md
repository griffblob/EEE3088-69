As our project for our 3088 electrcial design course we have to design subsystems to work in a micromouse. This project covers the design and production of sensing and power subsystems for a micromouse. Other systems such as processing subsystem, and motherboard are provided to us.

Project files for the sensing subsystem can be found in: [Sensing](https://github.com/griffblob/EEE3088-69/tree/main/EEE3088%20Sensing)

Project files for the power subsystem can be found in: [Power](https://github.com/griffblob/EEE3088-69/tree/main/EEE3088%20Power)
